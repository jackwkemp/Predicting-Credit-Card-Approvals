# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or denied. The model uses historical data about applicants' details, including personal and financial information.

## Objective
To predict credit card approval outcomes using machine learning algorithms on a dataset of applicant information.

## Files:
- **`cc_approvals.data`**: The dataset used to train the model.
- **`notebook.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the model-building process.

## Setup:
1. Install required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and others.
2. Load the dataset and explore the features in the notebook.
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
